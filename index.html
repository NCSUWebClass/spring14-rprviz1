<h1>About</h1>
<br />
<p>The Raleigh Public Record is an online newspaper and was interested in seeing visualizations of Wake County school systems data to potentially use in future investigative articles. 
Data is currently provided for free by the government however this data is in a less than optimal format. 
The data is hard to utilize and understand because of this, so using data provided in pdf and excel format by the government, we converted the data to an easier format to utilise, JSON. You can download this converter through our website.
We created visualizations depicting snapshots of each school district, percentage of a school needing free & reduced lunch over time, and several depicting the relationships between minorities and percentage needing free & reduced lunch over time.
 In the future, others can look at using our data for visualizing graphs investigating whatever interests them. If our team had time to create more graphs we would like to potentially make it so that a user could choose which y axis they want to compare over time for a graph similar to visualization 3.

 On our website you can download the converter source code we used to convert the given Wake County data to JSON format; we also provide links to our already converted JSON data.
 You can also view and interact with the visualizations we created.
